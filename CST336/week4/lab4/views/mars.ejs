    Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is known as the "Red Planet"
    because of its color, which comes from actual rust in the martian soil. Mars
    is roughly a tenth of the size of planet Earth, and has a thin atmosphere
    that is made up mostly of carbon dioxide. One of the interesting things
    about mars is that it has the tallest mountain in the solar system, Olympus
    Mons. It is an old volcano that rises 21.9km (72,000ft) above the surface.
    That's about as tall as 2.5 Mt. Everests. Mars' mountainous surface is
    evidence that the red planet had volcanic and geoligical activity as
    recently as 2 million years ago. Pretty rad!
