                <li><span class="hobby">Web Development</span>: <p>I have become increasingly fascinated with javascript development recently. After learning the capabilities of Node and all of its packages it feels like there are endless possibilities to what you can build with Javascript. I have been using the MERN stack to build single page web apps.</p></li>
                <li><span class="hobby">Guitar</span>: <p>I have played guitar for nearly twenty years now. That makes me feel really old. I don't have as much time to commit to it as I once did, but I still play a tune here and there.</p></li>
                <li><span class="hobby">Woodworking</span>: <p> Similar to programming, woodworking gives me a feeling of accomplishment knowing that I built something. I am not very good at it.</p></li>
                <li><span class="hobby">Video Games</span>: <p> I enjoy playing games when I can. Mainly on the PC, but I do own a Nintendo Switch for couch gaming.</p></li>
                <li><span class="hobby">Family</span>: <p>Not really a "hobby" but I have a one-year-old at home that gets the majority of my time. </li></p>
